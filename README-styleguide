Do your best to follow PEP8.

Here is a summation of the relevant bits:

Modules should be short and all lowercase. If multiple words, seperate with underscore
Class names should be CapWords (CamelCase)
Functions, methods, and variables should have all lowercase words separated with underscores. Use leading underscore to indicate that the method is not ment to be used outside of the class.
Constants should be all caps separated by underscores.
